W4V3 is a small Bash-based menu tool that wraps common wireless security utilities (aircrack-ng suite, reaver, bully, wifite, crunch, etc.) into a simple interactive menu. It helps automate common Wi-Fi tasks such as enabling monitor mode, scanning for networks, capturing handshakes, creating wordlists, and launching WPS attacks
